.ico files:

All the ico files aren't always good. You can find the ico files in website compromisation and it also act as a important backdoor for the   
reinfection occuring in the site.

To test whether the ico file is legitimate or not it can be appended with the extention .php  
When you found a malicious php code in that then it is an malicious backdoor.
Also most of the .ico files are in hidden state because of the extension .(dot) in the linux environment
